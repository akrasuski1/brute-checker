Example usage:

./run.py examples/actest.out


This command will run the tests stored in in/ folder, pass them through actest.out program, and store results in prog_out/ directory. Then it will compare them to expected output stored in out/ directory, and will evaluate it.
Note that any differences in whitespace are neglected.
You may specify a different time limit (default is 2.0 seconds) by writing a number before program:
./run.py 3.5 examples/actest.out
will make it run for 3.5s at most.
